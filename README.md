slurpeeth
=========

A very dumb, but hopefully good enough, TCP tunneling utility. Connect to interface(s), then send
that traffic to destination(s) -- thats it. Slurpeeth has no awareness/cares about *what* its
sending; meaning if you setup effectively a broadcast domain (multiple interfaces or destinations)
it will blindly forward traffic from source "a" to all destination(s).
